# Reverse Proxy Load Balancer System

---
## Overview

This system simulates a reverse proxy (load balancer) that distributes incoming requests to backend servers based on the least number of active connections. The backend servers simulate long-lived sessions or compute-intensive endpoints. The project is designed to handle HTTP-based web service requests and efficiently distribute them using a front-end load balancer.

## System Components

1. **Load Balancer (Gateway)**: This component is responsible for distributing incoming HTTP requests to backend servers based on their load.
2. **Backend Servers**: These servers handle requests from the load balancer. They simulate long-lived sessions or compute-intensive tasks.

---
## Key Features

- **Iterative Request Redirection**: Unlike traditional proxy systems, this solution uses an iterative approach to redirect clients to the backend server with the least active connections.
- **High Traffic Scalability**: The system optimizes resource utilization and improves scalability for high-traffic environments.
- **Centralized Control**: Despite the distributed backend architecture, the system maintains centralized control for optimal routing decisions.

## Deployment

Instead of using the local Docker-based setup, the system was deployed in a production-like environment using **Nomad** for container orchestration.

### ðŸ§© Infrastructure Setup

- **Nomad** was used as the orchestrator across all machines.
- On **each node** in the cluster:
  - ðŸ›¡ **Wazuh Agent** was installed to collect logs and monitor security.
  - ðŸ“¦ **Loki** was deployed to aggregate and store logs from the containers.
- The application code (load balancer and backend services) was deployed **only on designated nodes** using Nomad job files with constraints.
- Each component was managed through a declarative `.nomad` job specification.

### ðŸ“¡ Observability

All logs from the services are:
- collected by **Wazuh Agent**,
- streamed via **Promtail** (optional),
- stored and visualized through **Loki** and **Grafana** on the central monitoring server.

### ðŸ”— Live Demo

> ðŸ’¡ This deployment strategy ensures better scalability, security, and separation of concerns between logging, orchestration, and service logic.
