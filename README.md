# Reverse Proxy Load Balancer System

---
## Overview

This system simulates a reverse proxy (load balancer) that distributes incoming requests to backend servers based on the least number of active connections. The backend servers simulate long-lived sessions or compute-intensive endpoints. The project is designed to handle HTTP-based web service requests and efficiently distribute them using a front-end load balancer.

## System Components

1. **Load Balancer (Gateway)**: This component is responsible for distributing incoming HTTP requests to backend servers based on their load.
2. **Backend Servers**: These servers handle requests from the load balancer. They simulate long-lived sessions or compute-intensive tasks.

---
## Key Features

- **Iterative Request Redirection**: Unlike traditional proxy systems, this solution uses an iterative approach to redirect clients to the backend server with the least active connections.
- **High Traffic Scalability**: The system optimizes resource utilization and improves scalability for high-traffic environments.
- **Centralized Control**: Despite the distributed backend architecture, the system maintains centralized control for optimal routing decisions.

## Deployment

The system was deployed using **Nomad** as the orchestration platform across multiple virtual machines.

### ðŸ§© Infrastructure Setup

- All components were orchestrated using Nomad job specifications.
- **Wazuh Agent** was deployed via Nomad on every node for system-level security monitoring.
- **Loki** was also deployed through Nomad on every node, collecting and aggregating **application logs**.
- The **application code** (load balancer and backend services) was deployed only to appropriate nodes using Nomad's job constraints to control placement.
- Each component was declared in a dedicated `.nomad` job file for reproducibility.

### ðŸ“¡ Observability

Logs are handled by a unified logging stack:
- **Wazuh Agent** collects system-level and security-relevant logs.
- **Loki** aggregates application-level logs (e.g., from the load balancer and backend containers).
- **Promtail** forwards logs to Loki.
- **Grafana** provides a dashboard for viewing and analyzing logs in real time.
